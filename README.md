**Customer Churn Dashboard**

**Introduction**

The Customer Churn Dashboard is a web application built using Dash, a Python framework for creating interactive data visualizations. This dashboard aims to provide valuable insights into customer churn for a telecommunications company, helping product managers and stakeholders understand the factors influencing churn rates and make informed decisions.

**Features**
The dashboard includes the following key features:
1) Churn Rate by Selected Feature: A bar chart that allows users to visualize the average churn rate for a selected feature, such as contract type, internet service, or payment method.
2) Churn Rate by Gender: A bar chart that shows the average churn rate for male and female customers.
3) Churn Rate by Contract Type: A bar chart that visualizes how churn rates differ based on the type of contract (monthly, yearly, etc.).
4) Average Monthly Charges: A bar chart that compares the average monthly charges for customers who churned versus those who did not.
5) Satisfaction Score Distribution: A histogram that shows the distribution of satisfaction scores for churned and retained customers.
   
**Data Source**
The data used in this project is based on the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which includes information about customer demographics, services, and churn status. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file named telco.csv.

**Installation and Setup**
**Clone the repository:
bash**
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-dashboard.git

**Install the required dependencies:
bash**
pip install dash pandas numpy sqlite3

**Create an SQLite database from the CSV file:
python**
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('telco.csv')

# Create a SQLite database connection
conn = sqlite3.connect('telco_database.db')

# Write the DataFrame to a SQL table
df.to_sql('telco_customers', conn, if_exists='replace', index=False)

conn.close()

**Run the Dash application:
bash**
python churn_dashboard.py

**Product Analytics Insights**
The Customer Churn Dashboard provides valuable insights for product managers and stakeholders to understand and reduce customer churn:
1) Identifying High-Risk Customer Segments: By analyzing churn rates across different features, such as contract type and internet service, product managers can identify customer segments with higher churn risks and develop targeted retention strategies.
2) Understanding Factors Influencing Churn: The dashboard helps identify factors that significantly impact churn rates, such as satisfaction scores and monthly charges. Product managers can use this information to improve product features, pricing, and customer support.
3) Monitoring Churn Trends: The dashboard allows product managers to monitor churn rates over time and track the effectiveness of their retention efforts. They can compare churn rates before and after implementing new strategies or features.
4) Communicating Insights to Stakeholders: The interactive visualizations in the dashboard make it easier for product managers to communicate churn insights to executives, marketing teams, and customer service representatives, enabling a data-driven approach to decision-making.
